      <h2>Our goal is to classify the highlighted-in-pink <i>mask</i> (blob of pixels). </h2>
      You will see 2 versions of the same image, arranged in a row. From left to right, they will be the original image,
		then the blob of pixels highlighted in pink in the image.
      Sometimes the pink pixels will be hard to find. <b> You will sometimes need to zoom in to see clearly. </b>
      <h2> We will show a few examples of each category below: </h2>
      <h3><font style="color:red"> cup</font>: a container for holding liquids while drinking; includes mugs, and could be made of plastic, glass, ceramic, paper, or styrofoam. Cups include drinking glasses without a stem; if the cup/glass has a stem, it is a wine glass</h3>
