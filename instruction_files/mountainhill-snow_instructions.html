      <h2>Our goal is to classify the highlighted-in-pink <i>mask</i> (blob of pixels) belonging to a natural outdoor surfaces as either "snow", or as an "mountain/hill". </h2>
      <h3>
      <font style="color:red"> <b> "Snow" consists of small, soft, white pieces of ice that sometimes fall from the sky when it is cold.  </b> </font>  Snow is made of particles of frozen water vapor. </h3>

        <h3>
        On the other hand, for our purposes, <font color="red"> a "mountain" or "hill" is any land that is NOT entirely composed of snow.  </font> Mountains/hills naturally raised area of land, which can be high or craggy. Mountains rise conspicuously above their surroundings.  </h3>
        <p> <b> <i> We will be checking the quality of your work against pre-labeled image ground truth, so please be very careful about your work in order to be paid. </i> </b> </p>
            
      You will see 2 versions of the same image, arranged in a row. From left to right, they will be the original image, then the blob of pixels associated with the natural area (the "mask") highlighted in pink in the image.

      Sometimes the pink pixels will be hard to find. <b> You will sometimes need to zoom in to see the fabric clearly. </b>

      <h2> We will first show 6 examples of <i>snow</i>s, and then 6 examples of <i>mountains/hills</i>. </h2>

      <h3> Snow: </h3>
